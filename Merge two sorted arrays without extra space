Merge two sorted arrays without extra space
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2. Both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Merge both the arrays into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should be stored inside the array nums1 and it should be done in-place.
nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements of nums1 and rest are 0s.
nums2 has a length of n.

Examples:
Input: nums1 = [-5, -2, 4, 5], nums2 = [-3, 1, 8]

Output: [-5, -3, -2, 1, 4, 5, 8]

Explanation:

The merged array is: [-5, -3, -2, 1, 4, 5, 8], where [-5, -2, 4, 5] are from nums1 and [-3, 1, 8] are from nums2

Input: nums1 = [0, 2, 7, 8], nums2 = [-7, -3, -1]

Output: [-7, -3, -1, 0, 2, 7, 8]
Explanation:

The merged array is: [-7, -3, -1, 0, 2, 7, 8], where [0, 2, 7, 8] are from nums1 and [-7, -3, -1] are from nums2
