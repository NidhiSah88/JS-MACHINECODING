import { prototype } from "events"

q1: what are the different ways to create object in JS 
ans: 

Object constructor
eg: var obj = new Object();
Object's create method 
eg: var obj = Object.create(null);
Object literal syntax
eg: var obj = {};
let name = {name: 'nidhi'};
Function constructor 
eg: 
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;   
}
let obj = new Person('nidhi', 24);

Es6 class syntax 
eg:
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;   
  }
}
let obj = new Person('nidhi', 24);
Q2 difference b/w call, apply, bind 
Q3 difference b/w splice and slice 
q4 prototype chaining vs prototypal inheritance 
Q5: what is first class function in js 
q6: what is HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION 
q7: how do u redeclare a variable in swicth block without any error 
ans : 
switch(x){
    case 0 : {
        let name ;
        break ;
    }
    case 1 : {  
        let name ; // no syntax error for redeclaration
        break ; 
    }
}

q8 : what is temporal dead zone
q9 : what is memoization 
q10: what is closure and its scope chain 
ans : scope chains: inner function scope, access to outer function scope, 
acces to global scope 

q11: 

Coding question for senior developer 

Q1: Implement a function splitIntoGroups(array, size =1 ) that splits an array into subarrays of the given size .
the last group may be smaller if there are not enough elements. THE original array must remain unchnaged 
eg: splitIntoGroups([1,2,3,4,5], 2) => [[1,2], [3,4], [5]]
splitIntoGroups([1,2,3,4,5], 3) => [[1,2,3], [4,5]]
splitIntoGroups([1,2,3,4,5]) => [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
ans:

what challenges u faced, how did u solved it 

zepto :

js round:
event loop 
promises, async/await 
hoisting 
why promises came into picture, promises.all, settled promises 
hoisting 
closures and its output questions + primoses output question 
prototype and prototypal  inheritence 
this keyword 
flattening objects 
 
Machine coding round :
design form based ui using reactjs , there are three tabs : profile, interest, settings with specific fields requirements like:
age field: only numeric values allowed 
email field: validation to ensure the correct format 
Incorporate dropdowns, radio button, checkbox,
 implement validation for mandatory fields 
 data persistence accross tabs(suppose u open same tabe in one more diffrent browse , then data should stay there- how do you manage this - use local storage  )
a submit button that submitted the entire form only on the last  tab 
 asked for scalability, maitainability

Interviewer suggested creating form configuration object to dynamically generate the form , sparking a discussion about :

scalability: how easily the form could be extended or modified without rewriting significant portions of the code

maintainability : how  modular, readable and organized code is crucial for large teams and long -term projects


Hiring Manager round :
